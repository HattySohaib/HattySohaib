### Hey, I'm Sohaib Aftab.

I'm a freshman year student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh, India.
I have recently been learning and developing with the MERN stack. I have been interested in open source projects for long now, and am finally ready
to make useful contributions while also doubling down on my skills. I am a beginner in collaborative development but I am looking forward to learning from the community.
