<p>Iâ€™m a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at IIITDM Kurnool, passionate about solving real-world problems through software engineering and system design.

With hands-on experience in building full-stack and mobile applications, I've developed and deployed scalable solutions for ERP, mentorship, and education platforms. My tech stack includes React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express, React Native, MongoDB, Prisma, and AWS (EC2, S3). Iâ€™ve also explored areas of machine learning and RESTful API architecture.

Some highlights of my work:
- Built and deployed a role-based ERP system using Next.js + MongoDB, reducing manual workload by 50%.
- Delivered a NEET mentorship platform accessed by 100+ students from 10+ colleges.
- Published a reusable React blog component to npm with built-in theme support.
- Launched a cross-platform education app with 15+ screens, managed via a custom CMS.

Beyond development, I enjoy solving DSA problems, having solved 250+ questions on LeetCode with a contest rating of 1500+.

As the current GDSC Lead at my campus, Iâ€™ve led 6+ tech workshops and hosted a campus-wide hackathon, speaking to 100+ attendees â€” sharpening both my technical and communication skills.

ðŸŽ¯ Iâ€™m currently looking for full-time or internship roles in software development where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow.
