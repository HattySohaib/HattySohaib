### Hey, I'm Sohaib Aftab from India.

I am a student of Artificial Intelligence & Data Science at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design
and Manufacturing, Kurnool. I am broadly interested in web 2.0 and web 3.0 development technologies. 

I like to develop responsive, static or dynamic websites with the powerful MERN stack.I have worked on Backend-heavy webistes with authentication(passport.js, oAuth), RESTful APIs and Database management, as well as on Frontend-heavy websites like portfolios, business websites and SPAs (single-page applications based on React). I also enjoy designing interactive UI/UX prototypes on figma.

Presently, I'm trying my hands on Android+iOS development with React Native, and on Web 3.0 with Dfinity and Motoko. I am also trying to expand into Django/Flask based backend development since Python is one of the languagues I already know.

I have always been interested in open source development although I have little experience in collaborative development. So, I am looking forward to learning from the community.
